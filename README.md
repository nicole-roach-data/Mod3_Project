## Project Description
This Module 3 project of the Flatiron School Data Science program was an exercise to utilize hypothesis testing on a dataset. This project demostrates 4 hypotheses made on Marvel & DC characters dataset and how we use 2 t-Tests and 2 Chi-Square Tests in Python to answer the hypotheses. We also utilized BeautifulSoup & Selenium to web-scrape the Marvel & DC Fandom Wikia websites to collect updated data on the characters.

### Assignment
The goal of this project is to test our ability to analyze a dataset, as well as collection additional information using web-scraping, using our knowledge of statistical analysis and hypothesis testing to generate meaningful insights.

#### Our Hypotheses
1. Is there a relationship between FGSM status and alignment?
1. Is there a relationship between FGSM status and number of appearances?
1. Are villains more likely to be FGSM?

### Data Sources
